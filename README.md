|[**From O2 : Overstock & Obsolescence Yarn Stock to Sales Strategy**](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGup6YFVWw/cthioP16__UdIN8P9lVL7w/view?utm_content=DAGup6YFVWw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h85e2b449af) | The company regularly holds sales events to utilize overstock and obsolete yarns (O2). However, decision-making for which styles to promote with each yarn lacks a structured reference. We need to identify which styles have previously used each O2 yarn and determine which of them performed well, to guide future production and promotion decisions during sales events.|
|[**Monitoring Product Page Lifecycle & Sales Performance**](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGuqSfqWek/NL7B6IN_atMFhTSl2BHPWA/view?utm_content=DAGuqSfqWek&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h5e693022de)| The team currently lacks visibility into when a product page goes live on the website and how long it has been published. This makes it difficult to assess early performance or take timely action.|
